If we have a distance non-increasing map between metric spaces $g:(S, d)\\to (S^\\prime, d^\\prime)$ and a clustering method $F: (S, d)\\to (S, \\Gamma_S)$ and $F: (S^\\prime, d^\\prime)\\to (S^\\prime, \\Gamma_{S^\\prime})$, then we have $F(g): (S, \\Gamma_S)\\to (S^\\prime, \\Gamma_{S^\\prime})$, a morphism in $Part$ (i.e., it may merge clusters but it does not split them apart).\n",

    "### A random comment\n",
    "The class of clustering algorithms obtained by replacing the path of length $\\epsilon$ in single linkage clustering (i.e., require points be connected by a sequence of morphisms from some model space(s)) is equivalent to clustering algorithms satisfying the property that \"the clustering algorithm doesn't break up clusters any further when you apply it to the clusters themselves\" (\"excisive\", or idempotent). More explicitly, if $F$ partitions $(S,d)$ into $\\coprod_i (S_i, d_i)$, then $F$ applied to $(S_i, d_i)$ (viewed as a metric space in its own right) does not partition $S_i$ any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "There do exist functorial clustering algorithms that cannot be described in this way (i.e., cannot be described in terms of connecting points with maps from some class of model spaces) and therefore are not excisive (i.e., may result in further decomposition when applied to an element of a partition). Example due to Carlsson-MÃ©moli is single linkage with parameter $1 / min_{x,y} d(x, y)$. The point is that the threshold changes when you restrict to a component (since the minimum of a subset may be higher, the threshold may decrease on restriction to a subset, hence the cluster may further decompose)."
